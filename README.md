# 🖼️ Windows Forms C# 3D Object Viewer

A Windows Forms application developed using the .NET Framework for visualizing 3D objects. This project was created as part of a university assignment.

## 🌟 Features

- **3D Object Viewer**: Load, render, and interact with 3D objects directly in the application.
- **Intuitive Interface**: Built with Windows Forms for a simple and user-friendly experience.
- **Customizable Views**: Rotate, zoom, and pan to explore objects from different perspectives.
- **Lightweight and Portable**: Easily run the application on any Windows machine with .NET Framework installed.

## 🛠️ Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/t2ne/forms-cg.git
```
